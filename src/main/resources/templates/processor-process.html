    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <a th:href="@{documents/OPERATING SYSTEMS- LECTURE 2.pdf}">Lecture Notes</a>
    <p>
        A process is a program in execution. The status of a process is held by the program counter and
        the contents of the memory registers. A process is held in memory in the multiple section.


    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Text Section</dt>
        <dd>This section holds the code to be executed.</dd>
        <dt>Data Section</dt>
        <dd>This section holds the programs global variables.</dd>
        <dt>Heap Section</dt>
        <dd>This section is the memory that is dynamically allocated to the program during execution.</dd>
        <dt>Stack Section</dt>
        <dd>This section is temporal storage for invoking functions, that is the parameters and return values and local variables.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
        The size of the data and the text section are fixed as their sizes
        do not change in the execution of the program. On the other hand the heap and the stack section
         change as the program runs. Although the stack and the heap sections grow during execution
        the operating system should make sure that the two do not overlap.
    </p>

    <h2>Program vs Process</h2>
    A program is just information with the list of instruction stored in a location while
    a process is and active entity that has a program counter specifying the next instruction
    to execute along with allocates system resources. A program becomes a process when
    its executable file is loaded into memory.
    <h3>Process States</h3>
    A process can be in one of 5 states :
    <dl>
        <dt>
            New
        </dt>
        <dd>
            The process is being created.
        </dd>
        <dt>
            Running
        </dt>
        <dd>The instructions in the text part of the process are being executed.</dd>
        <dt>
            Waiting
        </dt>
        <dd>The process is wai
        <dt>Ready</dt>
        <dd>The process is waiting to be assigned to a processor.</dd>
        <dt>Terminated</dt>
        <dd>The process has finished execution</dd>
    </dl>
</div>

<div class="animate__animated animate__backInDown container shadow-lg p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded ">
    <h2>Process Control Block</h2>
    <p>
        A process in the operating system is represented with ta process control block.
        The PCB is made up of the following section:
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>
            Process State
        </dt>
        <dd>The process state is show which of the five states the process is in, that is
        new , running , waiting , terminated, ready</dd>
        <dt>Program Counter</dt>
        <dd>
            Ths program counter host the location of the next instruction to be executed.
        </dd>
        <dt>CPU Registers</dt>
        <dd>
            The registers vary in number and
            type, depending on the computer architecture
        </dd>
        <dt>CPU Scheduling</dt>
        <dd>
            This part contains the information about process priority, pointer to shceduling queues,
            and other scheduling parameters.
        </dd>
        <dt>Memory management Information</dt>
        <dd>This
            information may include such items as the value of the
            base and limit registers and the page tables, or the
            segment tables, depending on the memory system
            used by the operating system</dd>
        <dt>Accounting Information</dt>
        <dd> This information includes
            the amount of CPU and real time used, time limits,
            account numbers, job or process numbers, and so on.</dd>
        <dt>I/O Status Information</dt>
        <dd>This information includes
            the list of I/O devices allocated to the process, a list of
            open files, and so on.</dd>
    </dl>
</div>

    <h2>1. Process Creation</h2>
    <p>the state of the process here is new. During the creation of a process a process my
    also create many other processes. The process that creates the other processes is called
    a parent process. The processes are uniquely identified with their PID the id process identifier.
        <br/>
        For Example the process with PID 1 in a linux system will be the parent of all the processes
        which that particular user will create. The system process always has a PID of 1.

    </p>
</div>
<div class="animate__animated animate__backInDown container shadow-lg p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded ">
    <h2>2. Process Termination</h2>
    <p>A process terminates when it is finished executing its last instruction
    and asked the operating systems to delete it by executing calling exit() system call.
    The process may return a status value to the parent process via the wait() system call.
    All the resources given to the process are returned to the operating system.
    A process may terminate another process by invoking the TerminateProcess() system call.
        this system call can only be called by a parent process to its child processes. Cascading
        termination states that some systems donot allow childe processes to exist without the parent
        processes existing. Thus if the parent processs terminates then all its children processes
        are terminated.

    </p>

<div class="animate__animated animate__backInDown container shadow-lg p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded ">
    <h2>Process Classification</h2>
    Below is the hierarchy of the processes
    <dl>
        <dt>Foreground process</dt>
        <dd>This is the process that is currenly visible on the screen</dd>
        <dt>Visible process</dt>
        <dd>A process that is not directly visible
            on the foreground but that is performing an activity
            that the foreground process is referring to</dd>
        <dt>Service process</dt>
        <dd>this is a process similar to a background process but differs in that
        its execution is apparent to the user , like streaming music.</dd>
        <dt>Background process</dt>
        <dd>this is a process that executes in the background and is not apparent to the user.</dd>
        <dt>Empty process</dt>
        <dd>this is a process that holds no active components. </dd>
    </dl>
</div>
<div class="animate__animated animate__backInDown container shadow-lg p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded ">
    <h2>Threads</h2>
    <p>threads allow processes to have multiple execution streams. That is in a word
    processor one may have a Thread for typing and then another thread for spellchecking.
    This feature is most beneficial to systems with multi cores where each thread can executed on
    a different core allowing for parallel execution.</p>
</div>
<div class="animate__animated animate__backInDown container shadow-lg p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded ">
    <h2>Inter process communication</h2>
    <p>Processes of a operating system may be either independent of cooperating processes. There are three
    main reasons for having cooperating process :
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Sharing information</dt>
        <dd>processes may be interested in the same information and thus sharing of infomration
        for example in instances of copy and paste.</dd>
        <dt>Computation speedup</dt>
        <dd>
            If we want a particular task
            to run faster, we must break it into subtasks, each of
            which will be executing in parallel with the others.
        </dd>
        <dt>Modularity</dt>
        <dd>
            We may want to construct the system
            in a modular fashion, dividing the system functions into
            separate processes or threads.
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        There are two fundamental IPC these are
        <ol>
    <li>Shared Memory</li>
    <li>Message passing</li>
</ol>
    </p>

    <h2>Process Scheduling</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Multiprogramming -</b> This is most concerned with making sure that the cpu always has
        some process  that is executing.
        <br/>
        <b>Time Sharing-</b> this is most concerned with how to switch a CPU core
        among processes so frequently that users can interact
        with each program while it is running.
        <br/>
        To meet these objectives the use of a process scheduler is needed. The process scheduler
        is able to select an available process for program execution in the core.
        Each CPU core can run one proces at a time. The number of processes currently in memory is known
        as a degree of multiprogramming.
        <br/>
        Processes in multiprogramming and timesharing can be described in one of two ways.:
        <br/>
        <b>I/O bound Processor</b>- This is the process that spends most of its time doing input output
        than it spends calculating.
        <br/>
        <b>CPU-Bound Processes</b> - This is a process that spends most of its time doing computation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Processes's PCB are loaded into a queue that is in form of a linked list.
    </p>
    <img th:src="@{images/schedulingq.png}" width="400" alt="image of scheduling queue"/>
    <p>
        Another way to visualize process scheduling is through the use of queue diagrams.

    </p>
    <img th:src="@{images/queuediag.png}" width="600" alt="image of queueing diagram">
    <p>The <b>CPU scheduler</b> runs approximately every 100 milliseconds although usually
    it is much faster. If a process runs logner then it is forcibly stopped usually in the
    situation of <b> I/O Bound processes</b> which would be held by waiting for and <b>I/O request</b>.
    </p>
    <h4>Swapping</h4>
    <p>Some operating systems have and intermediate form of scheduling called swapping.</p>
    <h4>Context Switch</h4>
    <p>
        Context switch helps in the situation the a system call is made of a system interupt which
        causes the shceduler to save the state  that process the PCB loads the next one to the PCB
        and the executes that one.
    </p>

    <h2>Scheduling algorithms</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>
            FCFS - First Come First Service
        </dt>
        <dd>
            this is the first come fist serve algorithm. This is implemented using the
            FIFO algorithm. In a case like  below where P1 takes 27ms, P2 takes 3ms and P3 takes 3ms,
            the process flow chart will look like this;
            <img th:src="@{images/pflow.png}" alt="Image of flow chart.">
            the avarage wait time is given by all the wait times addad together then devided by the
            number of processes eg:
            (0 + 24 + 27) /3 = 17
        </dd>
        <dt>
            SJF  - Short job first.
        </dt>
        <dd>
            This scheduling algorithm assigns the order according to the shortest job first.
            so in the instance above the wait time would be
            (0 + 3 + 6) /3 = 3;
            this is because one of the two smaller processor burst time will be scheduled first.
        </dd>
        <dt>RR - Round Robin Scheduling algorith</dt>
        <dd>
            This scheduling algorithm is similar to the FCFS but only differs in that
            preemption is added to enable the system to switch between processes. The switching
            is deteming by a time slice or what is also call a time quantum
        </dd>
        <dt>Priority Scheduling</dt>
        <dt>In this scheduling algorithm a priority is given to each process. </dt>
    </dl>
